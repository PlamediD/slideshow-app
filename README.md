## About The Project

Welcome to the Image Gallery Project â€“ a dynamic, tech-savvy showcase of my visual journey through the year 2024. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive slideshow, 
allowing users to seamlessly navigate through a curated collection of images, each accompanied by a unique description. 
The responsive design ensures an optimal viewing experience across various devices. Whether it's capturing the essence of a Sunday service or embracing the candid moments of a family dinner, 
this project encapsulates the memories that shaped my 2024. Explore the visual narrative, relive the highlights, and embark on a digital adventure through the lens of my experiences. Happy browsing!

## Roadmap


### Features: 
1. Slideshow functionality: Allows users to navigate through images using previous and next buttons.
2. Automatic slideshow: Provides an option to start an automatic slideshow with a customizable interval.
3. Autoplay toggle: Enables users to toggle the automatic slideshow feature on and off.
4. Randomize button: Allows users to shuffle the order of images for a randomized viewing experience.
5. Fullscreen mode: Provides a fullscreen button for users to view images in fullscreen mode.
6. Navigation dots: Displays navigation dots at the bottom of the gallery to indicate the current slide and allow users to navigate directly to specific slides.
7. Image captions: Shows captions for each image to provide context or additional information.
8. Responsive design: Ensures the gallery layout adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes for optimal viewing experience.
9. Keyboard navigation: Supports keyboard navigation for users to navigate through images using arrow keys.
10. Accessibility: Strives to adhere to accessibility guidelines to ensure users of all abilities can access and enjoy the image gallery.

### A list of proposed features (and known issues):


1. Implement image preloading to ensure a smooth transition between images, especially for users with slower internet connections.
2. Include thumbnail images below the slideshow for quick navigation. Clicking on a thumbnail could display the corresponding image in the main slideshow.
3. Enhance the overall visual appeal by refining the styling. Consider using a modern color scheme, custom fonts, and subtle animations.
4. Consider pulling image data dynamically from a database or external source to make it easier to update and maintain.
5. Add social media sharing buttons to allow users to share their favorite images easily.
